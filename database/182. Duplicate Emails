/*
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.

//Using GROUP BY
SELECT  Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING count(*)>1


//Amazing solution
SELECT distinct p1.Email from Person p1
INNER JOIN Person p2
ON p1.Email = p2.Email
WHERE p1.Id <> p2.Id;
